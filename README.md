# NES-Emulator-Javascript

This is simply a personal project for me to learn more about emulation as well as Javascript. I hope to create a fully functional emulator that works on NES games.

Feel free to use this, but make sure to use it with ROM's you own and avoid piracy!

## ON HOLD Until I graduate in early June and have time :)
