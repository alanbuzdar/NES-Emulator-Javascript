# NES-Emulator-Javascript

This is simply a personal project for me to learn more about emulation as well as Javascript. I hope to create a fully functional emulator that works on NES games.

Feel free to use this, but make sure to use it with ROM's you own and avoid piracy!

To run:

Open index.html and hit browse and select a .rom file.

Debugging:

Uncommenting my print statements should slow the screen down enough for you to see individual frames

Developer tools in most web browsers are also powerful debugging tools and allow for things like breakpoints.
